/**
 * @brief
 *    The \c wcstombs_s function converts a sequence of
 *    wide characters from the array whose first element is pointed to by
 *    \c src to to its narrow multibyte representation from the current
 *    LC_CTYPE locale.
 *    If \c dest is not null, converted characters are
 *    stored in the successive elements of \c dest. No more than \c len bytes
 *    are written to the destination array. Each wide character is
 *    converted as if by a call to \c wcrtomb.  \c wcstombs_s
 *    clobbers the destination array from the terminating null and
 *    until \c dmax.
 *
 *    The conversion stops if: 
 *
 *    - The wide null character \c L'\0' was converted and stored. 
 *      The bytes stored in this case are the unshift sequence (if necessary)
 *      followed by \c '\0'.
 *
 *    - A \c wchar_t was found that does not correspond to a valid character
 *      in the current LC_CTYPE locale.
 *
 *    - the next multibyte character to be stored would exceed \c len.
 *      This condition is not checked if \c dst==NULL.
 *
 *    With SAFECLIB_STR_NULL_SLACK defined all elements following the
 *    terminating null character (if any) written in the array of dmax
 *    characters pointed to by dest are nulled. Also in the error cases for
 *    src = NULL, ESNOSPC and EILSEQ.
 *
 * @remark SPECIFIED IN

 * @param[out]  retval the number of characters converted

 *                     character string
 * @param[in]   dmax   The size in bytes of dest
 * @param[in]   src    wide string that will be converted to \c dest
 * @param[in]   len    number of bytes to be stored in \c dest, not
 *                     including the terminating null character.
 *
 * @pre \c retval and \c src shall not be a null pointer.
 * @pre dmax and len shall not be greater than \c RSIZE_MAX_STR
 *      (unless \c dest is null).
 * @pre \c dmax shall not equal zero (unless \c dest is null).
 * @pre \c dmax shall be greater than \c len.
 * @pre Copying shall not take place between objects that overlap.
 *
 * @note C11 uses RSIZE_MAX, not RSIZE_MAX_STR.
 *
 * @return  If there is a runtime-constraint violation, then if \c dest
 *          is not a null pointer and \c dmax is greater than zero and
 *          not greater than RSIZE_MAX_STR, then \c wcstombs_s nulls \c dest.
 *          Then the number of bytes excluding terminating zero that were,
 *          or would be written to \c dest, is stored in \c *retval.
 * @retval  EOK        on successful conversion.
 * @retval  ESNULLP    when retval or src are a NULL pointer
 * @retval  ESZEROL    when dmax = 0, unless dest is NULL
 * @retval  ESLEMAX    when dmax > RSIZE_MAX_STR, unless dest is NULL
 * @retval  ESOVRLP    when src and dest overlap
 * @retval  ESNOSPC    when there is no null character in the first dmax
 *                     multibyte characters in the src array and len is
 *                     greater than dmax (unless dest is null)
 * @retval  EILSEQ     if returned by wcstombs()
