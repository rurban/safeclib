/**
 * @brief
 *    Does not permit the \c ps parameter (the pointer to the conversion state) to
 *    be a null pointer.
 *    The restartable \c mbsrtowcs_s function converts a null-terminated
 *    multibyte character sequence from the current LC_CTYPE locale to wchar,
 *    which begins in the conversion state described by \c *ps, from the
 *    array whose first element is pointed to by \c *src to its wide
 *    character representation. If dest is not null, converted
 *    characters are stored in the successive elements of the
 *    \c wchar_t array pointed to by \c dest. No more than \c len wide
 *    characters are written to the destination array. Each multibyte
 *    character is converted as if by a call to \c mbrtowc.
 *    \c mbsrtowcs_s clobbers the destination array from the terminating
 *    null and until \c dmax. In extension to \c mbstowc_s you can re-use the
 *    state via \c ps.
 *    With SAFECLIB_STR_NULL_SLACK defined the rest is cleared with
 *    0.
 *
 *    The conversion stops if: 
 *
 *    - The multibyte null character was converted and stored. \c *src is
 *      set to \c NULL and \c *ps represents the initial shift state.
 *
 *    - An invalid multibyte character (according to the current C
 *      locale) was encountered. \c *src is set to point at the
 *      beginning of the first unconverted multibyte character.
 *
 *    - the next wide character to be stored would exceed \c len.
 *      \c *src is set to point at the beginning of the first unconverted
 *      multibyte character. This condition is not checked if
 *      \c dest==NULL.

 *
 * @pre retval, ps, src, or *src shall not be a null pointer.

 * @pre Copying shall not take place between objects that overlap.
 *
 * @note C11 uses RSIZE_MAX, not RSIZE_MAX_WSTR.
 *
 * @return  If there is a runtime-constraint violation, then if dest
 *          is not a null pointer and dmax is greater than zero and
 *          not greater than RSIZE_MAX_WSTR, then \c mbsrtowcs_s nulls dest.
 * @retval  EOK        on successful conversion.
 * @retval  ESNULLP    when retval, ps, src or *src are a NULL pointer
 * @retval  ESZEROL    when dmax = 0, unless dest is NULL
 * @retval  ESLEMAX    when dmax > RSIZE_MAX_WSTR, unless dest is NULL
 * @retval  ESOVRLP    when src and dest overlap
 * @retval  ESNOSPC    when there is no null character in the first dmax
 *                     multibyte characters in the *src array and len is
 *                     greater than dmax (unless dest is null)
