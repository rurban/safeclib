/**
 * @brief
 *    Does not permit the \c ps parameter (the pointer to the conversion state)
 *    to be a null pointer.
 *    The restartable \c wcrtomb_s function converts a single
 *    wide character to its narrow multibyte representation from the current
 *    LC_CTYPE locale that begins in the conversion state described by \c *ps.
 *    If \c dest is not null, the converted multibyte characters are
 *    stored in \c dest. Max. \c MB_CUR_MAX will be written to \c dest.
 *
 *    If \c dest is a null pointer, the call is equivalent to
 *    <tt>wcrtomb_s(&retval, buf, sizeof buf, L'\0', ps)</tt> with
 *    internal variables \c retval and \c buf (whose size is greater than
 *    \c MB_CUR_MAX).
 *
 *    If wc is the null wide character L'\0', a null byte is stored,
 *    preceded by any shift sequence necessary to restore the initial
 *    shift state and the conversion state parameter *ps is updated to
 *    represent the initial shift state.
 *
 *    If the environment macro __STDC_ISO_10646__ is defined, the
 *    values of type wchar_t are the same as the short identifiers of
 *    the characters in the Unicode required set (typically UTF-32
 *    encoding); otherwise, it is implementation-defined. In any case,
 *    the multibyte character encoding used by this function is
 *    specified by the currently active C locale.
 *
 *    If the environment macro __STDC_MB_MIGHT_NEQ_WC__ is defined,
 *    then for members of the basic character set multibyte-character
 *    encoding might not equal wide-character encoding
 *    (non-ASCII-based systems, such as EBCDIC-based systems, may use
 *    Unicode for their wide character encoding and still be
 *    conforming). ASCII-based systems with __STDC_ISO_10646__ defined
 *    leave __STDC_MB_MIGHT_NEQ_WC__ undefined.
 *
 *    With SAFECLIB_STR_NULL_SLACK defined all elements following the
 *    terminating null character (if any) written in the
 *    array of dmax characters pointed to by dest are nulled.

 * @pre dmax shall not equal zero (unless dest is null).
 * @pre dmax must be zero if dest is null.
 *
 * @note C11 uses RSIZE_MAX, not RSIZE_MAX_STR.
 *
 * @return Returns zero on success and non-zero on failure, in which
 *         case, \c dest[0] is set to '\0' (unless dest is null or dmax is zero or
 *         greater than RSIZE_MAX_STR) and \c *retval is set to (size_t)-1 (unless
 *         retval is null).
 *
 * @retval  EOK        on successful conversion.
 * @retval  ESNULLP    when retval or ps are a NULL pointer
 * @retval  ESZEROL    when dmax = 0, unless dest is NULL
 * @retval  ESLEMAX    when dmax > RSIZE_MAX_STR, unless dest is NULL
 * @retval  ESNOSPC    when dmax is smaller than the number of required bytes
