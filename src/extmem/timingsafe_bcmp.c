/**
 * @brief
 *    Compare all memory bytes. Return 0 or not zero.
 *
 *    The running time is independent of the byte sequences compared, making
 *    them safe to use for comparing secret values such as cryptographic
 *    MACs. In contrast, bcmp(3) and memcmp(3) may short-circuit after finding
 *    the first differing byte.
 *
 * @remark from OpenBSD
 *
 * @param  b1    pointer to memory to compare against
 * @param  b2    pointer to the source memory to compare with b1
 * @param  n     number of bytes to compare in both buffers
 *
 * @pre     Neither b1 nor b2 shall be a null pointer.
 *
 * @retval  0 if the buffers are equal, or not zero if they are not equal.
 *
 * @see
 *    memcmp_s(), timingsafe_memcmp()
