/**
 * @brief
 *    The memmove32_s function copies count uint32_t's from the region
 *    pointed to by src into the region pointed to by dest.
 * @details
 *    This copying takes place as if the count uint32_t's from the region
 *    pointed to by src are first copied into a temporary array of
 *    count uint32_t's that does not overlap the regions pointed to
 *    by dest or src, and then the count uint32_t's from the temporary
 *    array are copied into the region pointed to by dest.
 *
 * @remark EXTENSION TO
 *    ISO/IEC JTC1 SC22 WG14 N1172, Programming languages, environments
 *    and system software interfaces, Extensions to the C Library,
 *    Part I: Bounds-checking interfaces
 *
 * @param[out] dest   pointer to the memory that will be replaced by src.
 * @param[in]  dmax   maximum length of the resulting dest, in bytes
 * @param[in]  src    pointer to the memory that will be copied to dest
 * @param[in]  count  number of uint32_t's to be copied
 *
 * @pre   Neither dest nor src shall be a null pointer.
 * @pre   dmax shall not be 0.
 * @pre   dmax shall not be greater than RSIZE_MAX_MEM.
 * @pre   count shall not be greater than dmax/4.
 *
 * @return  If there is a runtime-constraint violation, the memmove_s function
 *          stores zeros in the first dmax characters of the region pointed to
 *          by dest if dest is not a null pointer and dmax is not greater
 *          than RSIZE_MAX_MEM.
 * @retval  EOK         when operation is successful or count = 0
 * @retval  ESNULLP     when dest/src is NULL POINTER
 * @retval  ESZEROL     when dmax = ZERO
 * @retval  ESLEMAX     when dmax/count > RSIZE_MAX_MEM
 * @retval  ESNOSPC     when dmax < count*4
