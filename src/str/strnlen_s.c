/**
 * @brief
 *    The strnlen_s function computes the length of the string pointed
 *    to by dest.
 *
 * @remark SPECIFIED IN
 *    ISO/IEC TR 24731-1, Programming languages, environments
 *    and system software interfaces, Extensions to the C Library,
 *    Part I: Bounds-checking interfaces
 *
 * @param  dest  pointer to string
 * @param  dmax  maximum length of string
 *
 * @pre  dest shall not be a null pointer.
 * @pre  dmax shall not equal zero.
 * @pre  dmax shall not be greater than RSIZE_MAX_STR.
 *
 * @return   The function returns the string length, excluding  the terminating
 *           null character.  If dest is NULL, then strnlen_s returns 0.
 *           Otherwise, the strnlen_s function returns the number of characters
 *           that precede the terminating null character. If there is no null
 *           character in the first dmax characters of dest then strnlen_s returns
 *           dmax. At most the first dmax characters of dest are accessed
 *           by strnlen_s.
 *
 * @see
 *    strnterminate_s()
