/**
 * @brief
 *    The \c fopen_s function opens a file indicated by filename and updates
 *    the pointer to the file stream associated with that file. mode is used to
 *    determine the file access mode.
 *
 * @remark SPECIFIED IN
 *    * C11 standard (ISO/IEC 9899:2011):
 *    K.3.5.2.1 The fopen_s function (p: 588-590)
 *    http://en.cppreference.com/w/c/io/fopen
 *
 * @param[out] streamptr pointer to a FILE stream that will be updated by this
 *                       function call
 * @param[in]  filename
 * @param[in]  mode      as in fopen
 *
 * @pre Neither streamptr, filename nor mode shall be a null pointer.
 *
 * If the file was created successfully, then the pointer to the FILE
 * pointed to by streamptr will be set to the pointer to the object
 * controlling the opened file. Otherwise, the pointer to the FILE pointed
 * to by streamptr will be set to a null pointer.
 *
 * @return The fopen_s function returns zero if it created the
 *         file. If it did not create the file or there was a
 *         runtime-constraint violation, fopen_s returns a nonzero error code,
 *         sets streamptr to NULL.
 *         If there is a runtime-constraint violation, fopen_s does not attempt
 *         to create a file.
 *         Sets the streamptr on success.
 * @retval  EOK        on success
 * @retval  ESNULLP    when any argument is a NULL pointer
 * @retval  > 0        any other errno
