/**
 * @brief
 *    The \c freopen_s function first, attempts to close the file associated
 *    with the stream, ignoring any errors. Then, if filename is not null,
 *    attempts to open the file specified by filename using mode as if by
 *    fopen, and associates that file with the file stream pointed to by
 *    stream. If filename is a null pointer, then the function attempts to
 *    reopen the file that is already associated with stream (it is
 *    implementation defined which mode changes are allowed in this case).
 *
 * @remark SPECIFIED IN
 *    * C11 standard (ISO/IEC 9899:2011):
 *    K.3.5.2.2 The freopen_s function (p: 590)
 *    http://en.cppreference.com/w/c/io/freopen
 *
 * @param[out] newstreamptr pointer to a FILE stream that will be updated by this
 *                          function call
 * @param[in]  filename     file name to associate the file stream to
 * @param[in]  mode         as in fopen
 * @param[in]  stream       the file stream to modify
 *
 * @pre Neither streamptr, stream nor mode shall be a null pointer.
 *
 * If the file was reopened successfully, then the pointer to the FILE
 * pointed to by newstreamptr will be set to the pointer to the object
 * controlling the opened file. Otherwise, the pointer to the FILE pointed
 * to by newstreamptr will be set to a null pointer.
 *
 * @return The freopen_s function returns zero if it reopened the
 *         file. If not or there was a
 *         runtime-constraint violation, freopen_s returns a nonzero error code,
 *         and sets newstreamptr to NULL.
 *         If there is a runtime-constraint violation, freopen_s does not attempt
 *         to reopen the file.
 *         Sets the newstreamptr on success.
 * @retval  EOK        on success
 * @retval  ESNULLP    when any argument is a NULL pointer
 * @retval  > 0        any other errno
